This is an integrated languages project involving C++ &amp; Java

This is an integrated languages project incorporating Java & C++. As our final Programming Languages course project, we were provided with a working Java class. We had to use the JNI C++ header to make use of this Java code in our C++ application.

## What Went Well
- Introduces file creation and parsing logic
- Converts string input from files & creates C++ objects that represent them
- Implements a variety of exception handling cases, including checking for data coming from the Java class that could not be validated at the user input level

## Opportunities For Improvement
- Additional exception handling logic
- RegEx for accurately validating user input
- editing/recompiling the provided Java code (as there were "issues")

## Challenges
- Working on a remote desktop and developing without working debugger tools in Eclipse, this project would be a prime candidate for additional refactoring

## Transferable Skills
- Language agnostic development
- Debugging 

## Maintainability, Readability, & Adaptability
- By using industry standard best practices, this project is written with an eye toward collaboration. It employs the OOP design priciples of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. And it is well commented throughout.
